# Edge-Cut Acrylic Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involved designing and developing a personal project using three lab machines: **Laser Cutter**, **Milling Machine**, and **3D Printer**. The chosen design was a **Soul Gem Holder**, inspired by a favorite game, featuring an acrylic piece that lights up when inserted.

## ✅ Key Features
- **Custom Acrylic Design**: Edge-cut and engraved using a laser cutter.
- **PCB Integration**: Designed in KiCad, milled using a CNC milling machine.
- **3D Printed Holder**: Created in Fusion 360 and printed using Ultimaker 2+.
- **Lighting Mechanism**: Pressure switch toggles LED lights when acrylic is inserted.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **KiCad**: PCB schematic and layout design.
- **Inkscape**: Vector design for acrylic cutting and engraving.
- **Fusion 360**: 3D modeling for holder design.
- **Milling Machine**: PCB fabrication.
- **Laser Cutter**: Acrylic cutting and engraving.
- **Ultimaker 2+**: 3D printing.

## 🔍 Design Process Summary
1. **Initial Concepts**: Eight design ideas, including nameplate, notification bar, lightsaber, wand, Alexa stand, cupholder, and soul gem holder.
2. **Chosen Design**: Soul Gem Holder for its complexity and functionality.
3. **Implementation**:
   - PCB designed and milled after resolving footprint and milling errors.
   - Acrylic engraved and cut using laser cutter.
   - Holder redesigned for better fit and printed successfully.

## 📦 Results
- **PCB**: Final version praised as the best in the lab group.
- **Acrylic**: Successfully engraved and cut with detailed design.
- **3D Print**: Completed after redesign for proper fit.
- **Final Assembly**: Fully functional, though slight measurement errors prevented perfect closure.
