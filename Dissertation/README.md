# Enhancing Accessibility in Extended Reality for Individuals with Tremors
# Overview 
Overview
This project explores how Extended Reality (XR) can improve accessibility for individuals with hand tremors, such as those caused by Parkinson’s disease or Essential Tremor. The core deliverable is a VR Aim Trainer that simulates tremor conditions to study user performance and experience, aiming to inform future rehabilitation tools and inclusive XR design.
# Key Features
1)  Simulated Tremor System: Dual-component tremor simulation (rotational jitter + movement amplification).
2)  Adaptive Target Positioning: Targets adjust based on user height for accessibility.
3)  Scoring System: Precision-based scoring (1–5 points per hit).
4)  Visual & Audio Feedback: Explosion effects and sound cues for engagement.
5)  WebXR Integration: Runs in-browser using React, Three.js, and React-Three/XR.
# Technologies Used
1)  Frontend: React, React-Three-Fiber, Drei
2)  XR Integration: WebXR via React-Three/XR
3)  3D Rendering: Three.js
4)  Hardware: Meta Quest 2/3
5)  Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
# Future Improvements
1)  Integration with clinical populations.
2)  Longitudinal studies for rehabilitation potential.
3)  Expanded performance metrics (reaction time, movement smoothness).
4)  Adaptive difficulty and accessibility features (voice instructions, haptic feedback).
